You are an expert in defining decision variables for optimization models using ZIMPL. Your task is to help define the **decision variables** in the context of an optimization problem. The decision variables will represent the quantities of various items in a given scenario.

The goal is to create **integer decision variables** that represent the number of units of each item being used in the model. The variables should be clearly defined with appropriate names that correspond to the items they represent.

#### Instructions:
1. **Each variable should represent the quantity of a particular item** (e.g., the number of units of a food product, the number of hours worked, etc.).
2. **Variables should be defined as integers**, as they represent discrete quantities (e.g., you can’t have a fraction of a food unit or work hour).
3. **The names of the variables should be clear** and should reflect the item they represent, so that anyone reading the model will easily understand what each variable stands for.
4. Ensure that each variable is followed by a **comment** that briefly explains what it represents.
5. Write only correct variables with description. Do not write any additional comenntary.

# EXAMPLES

[start example]
User:
A bakery produces Whole Wheat and Rye bread with specific resource requirements and profits. Whole Wheat bread uses 2 kg of flour and 1 kg of yeast per loaf, earning 5 Euros profit. Rye bread requires 3 kg of flour and 2 kg of yeast per loaf, yielding 7 Euros profit. With 600 kg of flour and 100 kg of yeast available, the task is to determine the production strategy that maximizes profit.

Assistant:
# Decision variables
var b1 integer; # Whole Wheat
var b2 integer; # Rye

User:
A company produces Standard and Advanced drones. Standard drones require 4 units of materials and 5 hours, yielding 50 Euros profit per unit. Advanced drones need 6 units of materials and 7 hours, generating 100 Euros profit per unit. With 400 units of materials and 300 hours available, the challenge is to determine the production strategy that maximizes profit.

Assistant:
# Decision variables
var d1 integer; # Standard drones
var d2 integer; # Advanced drones

"A large electronics company has two storage facilities, Storage 1 and Storage 2, and three retail stores: Shop A, Shop B, and Shop C. The company wants to maximize the revenue from shipping electronics, where the revenue per unit shipped is higher to Shop C.  
Storage 1 has 150 units available, Storage 2 has 200 units.  
Shop A needs 100 units, Shop B needs 120 units, and Shop C needs 130 units.  
The revenue per unit is as follows:
- From Storage 1 to Shop A: $5
- From Storage 1 to Shop B: $8
- From Storage 1 to Shop C: $10
- From Storage 2 to Shop A: $6
- From Storage 2 to Shop B: $7
- From Storage 2 to Shop C: $12"

Assistant:
# Decision variables
var xS1A integer;    # Units shipped from Storage 1 to Shop A
var xS1B integer;    # Units shipped from Storage 1 to Shop B
var xS1C integer;    # Units shipped from Storage 1 to Shop C
var xS2A integer;    # Units shipped from Storage 2 to Shop A
var xS2B integer;    # Units shipped from Storage 2 to Shop B
var xS2C integer;    # Units shipped from Storage 2 to Shop C

User:
A tailoring workshop makes trousers and jackets. For daily production, it uses two resources: fabric and labor. To make a pair of trousers, it requires 2 meters of material and 1 labor hour, while making a jacket requires 4 meters of material and 4 labor hours. The workshop can use 12 meters of material and 8 labor hours daily for production. The workshop earns 4 Euros for trousers and 10 Euros for a jacket from sales. Create a daily production plan that maximizes profit from sales.

Assistant:
var x1; # trousers
var x2; # jackets

User:
A doctor wants to combine two food kinds such that the mixture’s vitamin content includes a minimum of 8 elements of vitamin A and ten elements of vitamin C. Food ‘I’ includes 2 vitamin A units per kilogram and 1 vitamin C unit per kilogram. Food ‘II’ has 1 vitamin A unit per kilogram and 2 vitamin C units per kilogram. Food ‘I’ is priced at $5 per kilogram, whereas Food ‘II’ costs $7 per kilogram. Minimize the price of such a combination.

Assistant:
var x1; # Food 'I'
var x2; # Food 'II'

User:
An oil refinery purchases two types of crude oil, R1 and R2, at prices of 7000 PLN and 14000 PLN per processing unit, respectively. The fractional distillation process occurring in the rectification tower produces three products. From one processing unit of crude oil R1, 16 tons of gasoline, 20 tons of diesel, and 24 tons of residue are obtained. From one processing unit of crude oil R2, 48 tons of gasoline, 10 tons of diesel, and 14 tons of residue are obtained. How much R1 and R2 should be purchased to produce at least 48000 tons of gasoline and 20000 tons of diesel at the minimum raw material acquisition cost?

Assistant:
var x1; # amount of 1st crude oil purchased in tons
var x2; # amount of 2nd crude oil purchased in tons
