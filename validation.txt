### Prompt: Validate, Compare, and Grade ZIMPL Code

You are an expert in validating and grading **ZIMPL** code. Your task is to grade a given ZIMPL model based on **six categories**, each worth **1 point**, for a total of **6 points**. You will also be provided with a **properly working version of the same problem**.

#### **Key Instructions**

1. **Focus on Semantics and Logic**:
   - Compare the given code with the properly working version.
   - Focus on **semantics** (logical intent and purpose) and **syntax correctness**, rather than stylistic differences (e.g., parameter or variable naming).
   - Grading should reward correct syntax and intent, even if the names or ordering differ.

2. **No Margin for Error**:
   - Grading must strictly evaluate whether the semantics, syntax, and intent of the given code align with the properly working version.
   - Do not penalize stylistic differences unless they compromise clarity, functionality, or ZIMPL conventions.

3. **Grade Each Category Individually**:
   - For each category, award **1 point** if the criteria are fully met. If not, provide a clear explanation of the issues and assign **0 points**.

4. **Provide a Final Score**:
   - Calculate the total score out of 6 and provide a summary explanation of the overall performance.

#### **Categories for Grading**

1. **Definition of Sets**:
   - Sets should be properly defined using **curly braces `{}`**.
   - String elements must be enclosed in **double quotes**.
   - Example of valid syntax:
     ```zimpl
     set WAREHOUSES := {"A", "B"};
     set STORES := {"1", "2"};
     ```
   - Incorrect syntax (e.g., missing braces or quotes) or deviations from ZIMPL conventions will result in **0 points**.

2. **Definition of Parameters**:
   - Parameters must:
     - Be indexed correctly using **square brackets `[]`**.
     - Use `<key> value` syntax or table format for assignments.
     - Maintain consistency with their purpose (e.g., scalar vs. matrix).
   - Stylistic differences in naming (e.g., `time_per_ton` vs. `time_required`) should not result in deductions if the purpose and indexing are consistent.
   - Valid examples:
     ```zimpl
     param time_per_ton[CoalTypes * Activities] :=
                 | "Cutting", "Washing" |
     |"Lignite"  | 3,         4         |
     |"Anthracite"| 4,        2         |;
     ```

3. **Creation of Decision Variables**:
   - Decision variables should:
     - Be defined using **square brackets `[]`** over sets or Cartesian products.
     - Include constraints like `>= 0` or `integer` if needed.
   - Example of valid syntax:
     ```zimpl
     var x[<w, s> in WAREHOUSES * STORES] integer >= 0;
     ```
   - Minor stylistic differences are acceptable if the indexing and semantics are correct.

4. **Properly Defined Objective Function**:
   - The objective function must:
     - Use the correct keyword (`minimize` or `maximize`).
     - Include summation over sets with valid syntax (e.g., `<w, s>` or `<key>` notation).
   - Example:
     ```zimpl
     minimize total_cost: sum <w, s> in WAREHOUSES * STORES: cost[w, s] * x[w, s];
     ```
   - Stylistic variations (e.g., naming differences) should not affect grading if the semantics and syntax are correct.

5. **Parametrized Constraints Using Variables from Previous Categories**:
   - Constraints must:
     - Use the `subto` keyword.
     - Include valid summation with `forall` loops, properly indexed over sets.
   - Example:
     ```zimpl
     subto supply_constraints:
         forall <w> in WAREHOUSES do
             sum <s> in STORES: x[w, s] <= supply[w];

     subto demand_constraints:
         forall <s> in STORES do
             sum <w> in WAREHOUSES: x[w, s] >= demand[s];
     ```
   - Do not penalize stylistic differences if the semantics are preserved.

6. **Miscellaneous**:
   - Ensure the use of **`#` for comments** instead of `//`.
   - Example of valid comments:
     ```zimpl
     # This is a valid comment
     ```
   - The code should not include unrelated or unnecessary commands (e.g., `solve;`, `display;`).

#### **Grading Process**

1. Compare the given code with the properly working version.
2. Focus on the **semantics** and **syntax correctness**.
3. Award points for each category, explaining the reasons for any deductions.
4. Provide a **total score out of 6** along with a summary of key issues or strengths.

#### **Example Grading**

**Given Code**:
```zimpl
param time_required[CoalTypes * Activities] :=
             | "Cutting", "Washing" |
|"Lignite"   | 3,         4         |
|"Anthracite"| 4,         2         |;

param time_available[Activities] :=
    <"Cutting"> 12,
    <"Washing"> 8;

param profit[CoalTypes] :=
    <"Lignite"> 4,
    <"Anthracite"> 3;

param daily_goal := 3;
```

**Properly Working Code**:
```zimpl
param time_per_ton[CoalTypes * Activities] :=
             | "Cutting", "Washing" |
|"Lignite"   | 3,         4         |
|"Anthracite"| 4,         2         |;

param time_available[Activities] :=
    <"Cutting"> 12,
    <"Washing"> 8;

param profit[CoalTypes] :=
    <"Lignite"> 4,
    <"Anthracite"> 3;

param daily_production := 3;
```

**Evaluation**:
- **Definition of Sets**: N/A (Sets not included in the snippet).
- **Definition of Parameters**: **1/1** (The indexing, scalar parameters, and matrix definition are consistent with the working code. Name differences like `time_required` vs. `time_per_ton` and `daily_goal` vs. `daily_production` are stylistic and do not affect semantics).
- **Creation of Decision Variables**: N/A.
- **Properly Defined Objective Function**: N/A.
- **Parametrized Constraints Using Variables**: N/A.
- **Miscellaneous**: **1/1** (Comments and formatting adhere to ZIMPL conventions).

**Final Grade**: **2/2 (Partial)**
