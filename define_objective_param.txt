You are an expert in defining objective functions for optimization models using ZIMPL. Your task is to help define the **objective function** in the context of an optimization problem. The objective function will represent the goal of the optimization, which typically involves maximizing or minimizing some quantity, such as cost, profit, or resource usage.

The goal is to create an **objective function** that clearly defines the quantity to be optimized based on the decision variables and their respective coefficients.

#### Instructions:
1. **The objective function should represent the goal of the optimization** (e.g., minimizing cost, maximizing profit, etc.). Specify whether the function is a **minimization** or **maximization** problem.
2. **The function should include decision variables** (e.g., the number of units of items, hours worked) and their corresponding **coefficients**. These coefficients represent the impact of each decision variable on the objective.
3. **Ensure the coefficients reflect the values associated with each variable** (e.g., the cost of one unit of a food item, the profit from one hour of work, etc.).
4. **Use proper ZIMPL syntax** for defining the objective function, ensuring that it is clearly formatted and unambiguous.
5. **Do not include additional comments or explanations** in the objective function definition, only the function itself.
6. **Must not** start or end the code with the keyword ```zimpl ``` or ```.
7. You **must** not use the tags `[start example]` or `[end example]` when responding an answer.

For example we can have maximum 2 servings of eggs, one egg has 160 kcal of energy, 13 grams of protein, 54 milligrams of calcium and its price is 13 cents. 2000 kcal of Energy, 55 grams of Protein and 800 mg of Calcium is needed. Given prices for each food, we have to find a selection of foods that obeys the restrictions and has minimal cost. Integer variables are used, because only complete servings can be obtained, i. e., half an egg is not an option.

A bakery produces two types of cookies: chocolate chip and caramel. The bakery anticipates daily demand for a minimum of 80 caramelized & 120 chocolate chip cookies. Due to a lack of raw materials and labor, the bakery can produce 120 caramel cookies and 140 chocolate chip cookies daily. For the bakery to be viable, it must sell a minimum of 240 cookies each day. Every chocolate chip cookie served generates $0.75 in profit, whereas each caramel biscuit generates $0.88. The solution to the number of chocolate chip and caramel cookies that the bakery must produce each day to maximize profit may be determined using linear programming.

A tailoring workshop makes trousers and jackets. For daily production, it uses two resources: fabric and labor. To make a pair of trousers, it requires 2 meters of material and 1 labor hour, while making a jacket requires 4 meters of material and 4 labor hours. The workshop can use 12 meters of material and 8 labor hours daily for production. The workshop earns 4 Euros for trousers and 10 Euros for a jacket from sales. Create a daily production plan that maximizes profit from sales.

A doctor wants to combine two food kinds such that the mixture’s vitamin content includes a minimum of 8 elements of vitamin A and ten elements of vitamin C. Food ‘I’ includes 2 vitamin A units per kilogram and 1 vitamin C unit per kilogram. Food ‘II’ has 1 vitamin A unit per kilogram and 2 vitamin C units per kilogram. Food ‘I’ is priced at $5 per kilogram, whereas Food ‘II’ costs $7 per kilogram. Minimize the price of such a combination.

An oil refinery purchases two types of crude oil, R1 and R2, at prices of 7000 PLN and 14000 PLN per processing unit, respectively. The fractional distillation process occurring in the rectification tower produces three products. From one processing unit of crude oil R1, 16 tons of gasoline, 20 tons of diesel, and 24 tons of residue are obtained. From one processing unit of crude oil R2, 48 tons of gasoline, 10 tons of diesel, and 14 tons of residue are obtained. How much R1 and R2 should be purchased to produce at least 48000 tons of gasoline and 20000 tons of diesel at the minimum raw material acquisition cost?

One type of cake calls for 200g of flour and 25g of fat, but another one calls for 100g of flour and 50g of fat. This issue may be expressed as a linear programming problem to determine the highest proportion of cake that can be baked using 5kg of flour and 1kg of fat. (Maximize the quantities of cakes in total). It also implies that there are sufficient quantities of the other cake-making components. (1kg = 1000g)

Two types of coal, A priced at 500 PLN per ton and B priced at 400 PLN per ton, contain impurities of phosphorus and iron compounds. In a certain industrial process, at least 90 tons of fuel are required, containing no more than 0.03% phosphorus and no more than 4% iron. The percentage of impurities in coal type A is: phosphorus 0.02% and iron 3%. The percentage of impurities in coal type B is: phosphorus 0.05% and iron 5%. How should the two types of coal be mixed to obtain fuel at the lowest possible cost that meets the above requirements?
