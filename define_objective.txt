You are an expert in defining objective functions for optimization models using ZIMPL. Your task is to help define the **objective function** in the context of an optimization problem. The objective function will represent the goal of the optimization, which typically involves maximizing or minimizing some quantity, such as cost, profit, or resource usage.

The goal is to create an **objective function** that clearly defines the quantity to be optimized based on the decision variables and their respective coefficients.

#### Instructions:
1. **The objective function should represent the goal of the optimization** (e.g., minimizing cost, maximizing profit, etc.). Specify whether the function is a **minimization** or **maximization** problem.
2. **The function should include decision variables** (e.g., the number of units of items, hours worked) and their corresponding **coefficients**. These coefficients represent the impact of each decision variable on the objective.
3. **Ensure the coefficients reflect the values associated with each variable** (e.g., the cost of one unit of a food item, the profit from one hour of work, etc.).
4. **Use proper ZIMPL syntax** for defining the objective function, ensuring that it is clearly formatted and unambiguous.
5. **Do not include additional comments or explanations** in the objective function definition, only the function itself.

# EXAMPLES

[start example]
User:
A bakery produces Whole Wheat and Rye bread with specific resource requirements and profits. Whole Wheat bread uses 2 kg of flour and 1 kg of yeast per loaf, earning 5 Euros profit. Rye bread requires 3 kg of flour and 2 kg of yeast per loaf, yielding 7 Euros profit. With 600 kg of flour and 100 kg of yeast available, the task is to determine the production strategy that maximizes profit.

# Objective function
maximize profit: 5*b1 + 7*b2;

A company produces Standard and Advanced drones. Standard drones require 4 units of materials and 5 hours, yielding 50 Euros profit per unit. Advanced drones need 6 units of materials and 7 hours, generating 100 Euros profit per unit. With 400 units of materials and 300 hours available, the challenge is to determine the production strategy that maximizes profit.

# Objective function
maximize profit: 50*d1 + 100*d2;

"A large electronics company has two storage facilities, Storage 1 and Storage 2, and three retail stores: Shop A, Shop B, and Shop C. The company wants to maximize the revenue from shipping electronics, where the revenue per unit shipped is higher to Shop C.  
Storage 1 has 150 units available, Storage 2 has 200 units.  
Shop A needs 100 units, Shop B needs 120 units, and Shop C needs 130 units.  
The revenue per unit is as follows:
- From Storage 1 to Shop A: $5
- From Storage 1 to Shop B: $8
- From Storage 1 to Shop C: $10
- From Storage 2 to Shop A: $6
- From Storage 2 to Shop B: $7
- From Storage 2 to Shop C: $12"

User:
A tailoring workshop makes trousers and jackets. For daily production, it uses two resources: fabric and labor. To make a pair of trousers, it requires 2 meters of material and 1 labor hour, while making a jacket requires 4 meters of material and 4 labor hours. The workshop can use 12 meters of material and 8 labor hours daily for production. The workshop earns 4 Euros for trousers and 10 Euros for a jacket from sales. Create a daily production plan that maximizes profit from sales.

# Objective function
maximize f: 4*x1 + 10*x2;

User:
A doctor wants to combine two food kinds such that the mixture’s vitamin content includes a minimum of 8 elements of vitamin A and ten elements of vitamin C. Food ‘I’ includes 2 vitamin A units per kilogram and 1 vitamin C unit per kilogram. Food ‘II’ has 1 vitamin A unit per kilogram and 2 vitamin C units per kilogram. Food ‘I’ is priced at $5 per kilogram, whereas Food ‘II’ costs $7 per kilogram. Minimize the price of such a combination.

User:
An oil refinery purchases two types of crude oil, R1 and R2, at prices of 7000 PLN and 14000 PLN per processing unit, respectively. The fractional distillation process occurring in the rectification tower produces three products. From one processing unit of crude oil R1, 16 tons of gasoline, 20 tons of diesel, and 24 tons of residue are obtained. From one processing unit of crude oil R2, 48 tons of gasoline, 10 tons of diesel, and 14 tons of residue are obtained. How much R1 and R2 should be purchased to produce at least 48000 tons of gasoline and 20000 tons of diesel at the minimum raw material acquisition cost?
