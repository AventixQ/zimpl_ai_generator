You are an expert in defining sets for linear problems using ZIMPL. Your task is to help define the **sets** that will represent the various elements involved in the optimization problem.

#### Instructions:
1. **Each set should represent a collection of elements** that will be used in the problem, such as types, categories, or groups of items.
2. **Each set should clearly reflect the elements it contains**, such as foods, products, or resources.
3. **The set definition should be clear and concise**, listing all the items it contains.
4. **Do not include additional comments or explanations** outside of the set definition itself.
5. Answer only like in examples, so do not provide full zimpl code.

"Given a set of foods Food = { ""Oatmeal"", ""Chicken"", ""Eggs"", ""Milk"", ""Pie"", ""Pork"" } and a set of nutrients Nutrients = { ""Energy"", ""Protein"", ""Calcium"" }, we have a table
            |""Servings"" ,""Energy""   ,""Protein""  ,""Calcium""  ,""Price""    |
|""Oatmeal""  |          4,        110,          4,          2,          3|
|""Chicken""  |          3,        205,         32,         12,         24|
|""Eggs""     |          2,        160,         13,         54,         13|
|""Milk""     |          8,        160,          8,        284,          9|
|""Pie""      |          2,        420,          4,         22,         20|
|""Pork""     |          2,        260,         14,         80,         19|
For example we can have maximum 2 servings of eggs, one egg has 160 kcal of energy, 13 grams of protein, 54 milligrams of calcium and its price is 13 cents. 2000 kcal of Energy, 55 grams of Protein and 800 mg of Calcium is needed. Given prices for each food, we have to find a selection of foods that obeys the restrictions and has minimal cost. Integer variables are used, because only complete servings can be obtained, i. e., half an egg is not an option.

A tailoring workshop makes trousers and jackets. For daily production, it uses two resources: fabric and labor. To make a pair of trousers, it requires 2 meters of material and 1 labor hour, while making a jacket requires 4 meters of material and 4 labor hours. The workshop can use 12 meters of material and 8 labor hours daily for production. The workshop earns 4 Euros for trousers and 10 Euros for a jacket from sales. Create a daily production plan that maximizes profit from sales.

A doctor wants to combine two food kinds such that the mixture’s vitamin content includes a minimum of 8 elements of vitamin A and ten elements of vitamin C. Food ‘I’ includes 2 vitamin A units per kilogram and 1 vitamin C unit per kilogram. Food ‘II’ has 1 vitamin A unit per kilogram and 2 vitamin C units per kilogram. Food ‘I’ is priced at $5 per kilogram, whereas Food ‘II’ costs $7 per kilogram. Minimize the price of such a combination.

Assistant:
# Sets
set Foods := {"FoodI", "FoodII"};
set Vitamins := {"VitaminA", "VitaminC"};

User:
An oil refinery purchases two types of crude oil, R1 and R2, at prices of 7000 PLN and 14000 PLN per processing unit, respectively. The fractional distillation process occurring in the rectification tower produces three products. From one processing unit of crude oil R1, 16 tons of gasoline, 20 tons of diesel, and 24 tons of residue are obtained. From one processing unit of crude oil R2, 48 tons of gasoline, 10 tons of diesel, and 14 tons of residue are obtained. How much R1 and R2 should be purchased to produce at least 48000 tons of gasoline and 20000 tons of diesel at the minimum raw material acquisition cost?

# Sets
set CrudeOils := {"R1", "R2"};

One type of cake calls for 200g of flour and 25g of fat, but another one calls for 100g of flour and 50g of fat. This issue may be expressed as a linear programming problem to determine the highest proportion of cake that can be baked using 5kg of flour and 1kg of fat. (Maximize the quantities of cakes in total). It also implies that there are sufficient quantities of the other cake-making components. (1kg = 1000g)

set Cakes := {"Cake1", "Cake2"};
set Resources := {"Flour", "Fat"};

User:
Two types of coal, A priced at 500 PLN per ton and B priced at 400 PLN per ton, contain impurities of phosphorus and iron compounds. In a certain industrial process, at least 90 tons of fuel are required, containing no more than 0.03% phosphorus and no more than 4% iron. The percentage of impurities in coal type A is: phosphorus 0.02% and iron 3%. The percentage of impurities in coal type B is: phosphorus 0.05% and iron 5%. How should the two types of coal be mixed to obtain fuel at the lowest possible cost that meets the above requirements?

# Sets
set CoalTypes := {"CoalA", "CoalB"};
set Impurities := {"Phosphorus", "Iron"};
