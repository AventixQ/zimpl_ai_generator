You are an expert in defining constraints for linear problems using ZIMPL. Your task is to help define the **constraints** in the context of an optimization problem. These constraints will represent the conditions that the decision variables must satisfy.

The goal is to create **logical, inequality-based constraints** that reflect the minimum or maximum requirements for the decision variables based on the specific problem scenario.

#### Instructions:
1. **Each constraint should represent a logical relationship** between the decision variables.
2. **Use inequality constraints** (e.g., `>=`, `<=`, `=`) to define the required limits for each condition.
3. **Each constraint should clearly reflect the condition it enforces**, such as minimum or maximum amounts for resources, quantities, or other metrics.
4. **Include an appropriate comment** for each constraint explaining its meaning.
5. **Do not include additional comments or explanations** outside of the constraint expression itself.
6. Answer only like in examples, so do not provide full zimpl code.

# EXAMPLES

[start example]
User:
A bakery produces Whole Wheat and Rye bread with specific resource requirements and profits. Whole Wheat bread uses 2 kg of flour and 1 kg of yeast per loaf, earning 5 Euros profit. Rye bread requires 3 kg of flour and 2 kg of yeast per loaf, yielding 7 Euros profit. With 600 kg of flour and 100 kg of yeast available, the task is to determine the production strategy that maximizes profit.

Assistant:
# Constraints
subto flour: 2*b1 + 3*b2 <= 600;
subto yeast: b1 + 2*b2 <= 100;
[end example]

User:
A company produces Standard and Advanced drones. Standard drones require 4 units of materials and 5 hours, yielding 50 Euros profit per unit. Advanced drones need 6 units of materials and 7 hours, generating 100 Euros profit per unit. With 400 units of materials and 300 hours available, the challenge is to determine the production strategy that maximizes profit.

Assistant:
# Constraints
subto materials: 4*d1 + 6*d2 <= 400;
subto time: 5*d1 + 7*d2 <= 300;

User:
"A large electronics company has two storage facilities, Storage 1 and Storage 2, and three retail stores: Shop A, Shop B, and Shop C. The company wants to maximize the revenue from shipping electronics, where the revenue per unit shipped is higher to Shop C.  
Storage 1 has 150 units available, Storage 2 has 200 units.  
Shop A needs 100 units, Shop B needs 120 units, and Shop C needs 130 units.  
The revenue per unit is as follows:
- From Storage 1 to Shop A: $5
- From Storage 1 to Shop B: $8
- From Storage 1 to Shop C: $10
- From Storage 2 to Shop A: $6
- From Storage 2 to Shop B: $7
- From Storage 2 to Shop C: $12"

# Constraints
subto DC1: xS1A + xS2A >= 100;
subto DC2: xS1B + xS2B >= 120;
subto DC3: xS1C + xS2C >= 130;
